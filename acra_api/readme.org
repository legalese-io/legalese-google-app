* ACRA API for retrieving company business profiles.
** What this is
   This is just app.js: i.e., just the file which runs the node API.
** What you actually need/to do to use this
   - [[https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/][Install MongoDB]]
   - As with all node projects:
     - ~npm install mongodb~ (note: mongodb and mongo are /not/ the same thing)
     - ~npm install body-parser~
     - ~npm install express~
   - Put ~index.js~ in your project root folder.
   - Get the UEN XML file from [[http://ref.data.gov.sg/UENfiles/UEN_DATAGOV.zip][data.gov]]
   - Translate it to JSON with [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js][xml2js]], or better still [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-to-json][a Haskell parser]]
   - Because MongoDB only takes inserts of up to 16mb, split the file using the python script included
   - Create a new mongod instance while in the project directory with ~mongod --dbpath=/foo~
   - Insert with ~ls -1 *.json | while read jsonfile; do mongoimport --database foo --collection bar --file $jsonfile --jsonArray --type json; done~
     - Note: if overwriting, drop the database first.
   - Change the relevant fields in ~app.js~ to the correct database name.
   - Ensure that mongod is running. Open another terminal instance with ~mongod~.
   - Use ~db.<collection>.find({ENTITY_NAME:"<name>"})~ to make sure your data is in there.
   - Run ~index.js~ with ~nohup node index.js &~ - if background is required.
** How to query
   - GET requests to:
     - http://localhost:8080/api/company/foo for company name search
     - http://localhost:8080/api/company/uen/bar for UEN search
